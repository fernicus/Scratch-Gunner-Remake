# Scratch-Gunner-Remake

In high school, I had to learn to use Scratch for a Science Olympiad event. This led to me making a small spaceship-shooter game in my free 
time as a sort of practice, which I eventually dubbed “Scratch Gunner.” What started as just a small exercise ended up becoming fairly deep 
with dozens of sprites and many blocks of code, and eventually the high-level inefficiencies of Scratch made it so that any new additions to 
the game were increasingly difficult to actualize. After having used Unity, I believe now  is the time for me to remake my pet project in a new
and better way, which I have wanted to do for a long time but never had a good enough understanding of how to do so.

The essence of this project is to design and program a functional spaceship-shooter game in Unity that should capture the spirit of the 
gameplay of the original Scratch Gunner game. 

Milestones:
Baseline player gameplay (can the player move, aim, shoot, take damage, etc.) and baseline enemy behavior (move, perform basic attacks, be able
to be destroyed)

Newer and more complex enemy behavior (increased diversity of attack patterns, more movement options, maybe even more enemies)

Additional player gameplay elements (variety of equipment/power-ups)

General aesthetics improvements (actual textures, improved animation fluidity, lighting effects, sound, music?)
