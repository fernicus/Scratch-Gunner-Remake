Scratch Gunner Remake

This week:
The player character can now move using WASD and aim towards the cursor. A small sphere has been added to act as a shot, and it can create one
clone of itself at a time by pressint the space bar, and this clone can be destroyed successfully when needed. The camera moves along with the
player to keep the player character centered onscreen, and a bounding box has been created to keep all the game objects within.

Next week:
All these newly added objects must be refined and polished.

Technical holds:
No holds.
