Scratch Gunner Remake

This week:
Nearly nothing happened, just the presentation and some small aesthetic improvements to the arena in preparation for said presentation.

Next week:
There probably isn't enough time left to code up anything complex, so the final week will probably just be more polishing.

Technical holds:
The final week *is* finals week, after all, so I might not be able to get around to doing a whole lot of work on this project.
