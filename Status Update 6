Scratch Gunner Remake

This week:
The second, third, and fourth attack patterns are complete! In the second attack, the enemy will warp several times and create bursts of 4 projectiles. In the third, it will create 
3-shot bursts directed at the player multiple times. In the fourth, it moves to the center of the arena and sprays small shots randomly in all directions. Additionally, all these
attacks will become more aggressive as the enemy loses HP: the shots will move progressively faster, and once it drops below half HP, attack 1 will summon 12 projectiles instead of 8,
and attack 2 will create 6 projectiles per burst instead of 4.

Next week:
More attacks will be modeled and coded, ideally up to a total of somewhere between 6 or 8. Additionally, the original Scratch Gunner had two mechanics that are still as of yet 
unimplemented: a shield, which could block attacks for a short period before needing to recharge over time; and a small indicator showing the level of charge for a charge shot. If 
coding remaining attack patterns goes smoothly, hopefully these can be implemented.

Technical holds:
No holds.
