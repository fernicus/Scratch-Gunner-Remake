Status Update 1
Scratch Gunner Remake

This week:
The project is officially created! I have written up the project proposal and this status update. I have also updated Unity to the newest 
version if that counts.

Next week:
I will return to the project where I left off many months ago. The first order of business is to get the player character moving properly. If
that goes smoothly, I will next add an object to create instances of as shots, and model something to use as an enemy.

Technical holds:
No holds.
